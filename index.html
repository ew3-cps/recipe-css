            <p class="historyText">
                Soda bread, although often attributed to Ireland as Irish soda bread, comes from the <u>Native Americans</u> who would make a 
                leavened bread with pearl ash. This method of making a sweeter more scone-like bread became popular in Ireland in the mid 
                19th century, but instead of ash, they used baking soda (bicarbonate). Bread as a whole has been around for centuries, 
                people have been baking and consuming bread since the earlies recorded findings of bread in the middle east around 
                8000 BC. The earlier forms of bread were much different than the bread that we know today, the original form of bread
                can be most similarly compared to what we now know as a tortilla. Grain was crushedand baked along with other
                ingredients to make this early form of bread, no yeast or other leavening agent was used.
